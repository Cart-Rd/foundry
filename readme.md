Welcome to the repo of Foundry. Foundry is the command line tool for Vesper PHP. It helps you build websites quickly.

## Command line

You can build your `models` and `controllers` quickly via Foundry. Just type `php foundry mcv:build name//m/v/c/t` and you are good to go! Files will be created instantly.

## Swappable

If you do not like Foundry you can swap this CLI tool for another one. One you build yourself for instance. If you do, please let me know.

## Only for Vesper

Foundry will probably only work on Vesper but if you want to use it for another tool, be my guest!
